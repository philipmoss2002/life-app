- The app does not scan, modify, or access any other files on your device

## Permissions

The app requires the following permissions:

### Storage/File Access
- **Purpose**: To allow you to select and attach files to your documents
- **Usage**: Only activated when you tap "Attach Files" button
- **Scope**: Limited to files you explicitly select

### Notifications

## Data Security

### Local Security
- Your data is protected by your device's security measures (PIN, password, biometric authentication)
- We recommend keeping your device locked and secure
- The app does not implement additional encryption (data security relies on device-level security)

### No Network Transmission
- Since no data is transmitted over networks, there is no risk of interception
- Your documents and files remain private on your device

## Your Rights and Control

### Access
- You can view all your documents and information within the app at any time

### Modification
- You can edit or update any document information

### Deletion
- You can delete individual documents at any time
- Deleting a document removes it from the app's database

### Complete Data Removal
To completely remove all app data:
1. Uninstall the app from your device
2. This will delete the app's database and all document information
3. Your original files will remain on your device

## Children's Privacy

The app does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The app is designed for household document management and is suitable for all ages. Since all data is stored locally and no information is collected or transmitted, there are no special privacy concerns for children using the app.

## Third-Party Services

### No Third-Party Data Sharing

These libraries operate locally on your device and do not transmit data externally.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
